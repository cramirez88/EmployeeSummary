## INSTALLATION
- Clone the repo for use on your local machine
- Use the command line to locate the cloned repo and make it your current directory
- Type `npm install` in the command line
- This will install the node module packages and dependencies, including inquirer, which is necessary for proper application functionality
- Additionally, create a folder entitled `output` in the directory; this is where the final generated html file will be located once it has been written

## USAGE
- To use the "Template Engine for Teams and Employees" application...
- Use the command line to locate the cloned repo and make it your current directory
- Simply type `node app.js` in the command line
- A series of prompts will inquire about the following items:
    - What is the employee's name?
    - What is the employee's id number?
        - Validation ensures that the id is a valid number
    - What is the employee's email address?
        - Validation ensures that the email is a valid email address
    - This employee is what type of person? (Manager, Intern, Engineer)
    - Depending on the type of person, a subset of questions is asked:
        - Manager: What is the manager's office number?
        - Intern: What school does this student attend?
        - Engineer: Please enter your GitHub username (not the URL, just the username)?
    - Following this, a prompt inquires if the user has more employees to add
    - If they select yes, the series of previous prompts repeats
    - If they select no, the prompts terminate
- When the prompts have terminated and all the inquires have responses, the program generates an HTML file, dynamically displaying a team's employee data and credentials.
